module for applying fiducial cuts to g11 synthetic data for the A(I)DAPT project

Module consists of 3 classes and 1 executable, written in Python by Tyler. 

scripts:
apply_fiducial.py
dataManager.py
event.py
fiducialCuts.py

*************************************************
fiducialCuts.py script contains:
defines class FiducialCuts where fiducial cuts for g11 are defined
defines method to check if event passes all fiducial cuts

private methods for applying cuts

Fiducial cuts for g11:
1) cut out low momentum protons: Pp > 375 MeV
2) cut out very forward tracks: cosTheta > 0.985
3) cut out space between sectors: |phi| < 26 deg

if these need to be changed, do so in fidicualCuts.py lines 9-13

*************************************************

event.py 
gets information from synthetic data file 
defines theta, phi, and momenta for each particle
the particles are identified by their place in .numpy array with order as follows

**************************************************

**************************************************
apply_fiducial.py

reads in data file 
for each event (i.e. row), checks whether event passes fiducial cuts
    if it does pass, event is added to output_array
    if it does not, it is removed from this new array (but not from the original data file!)
**************************************************

**************************************************
dataManager.py

converts .txt or .zzz input file into numpy array
