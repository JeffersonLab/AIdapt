General instructions to run simulations on g11 data interactively:

****************

location of input files and wrapper scripts: /volatile/clas/clasg11/roark/aidaptContainerTesting

input files:
	⁃	gsiman.input: FFREAD card for GSIM
	⁃	new_recsis.tcl: input for USER_ANA

wrapper scripts:
	⁃	do_gpp.sh
	⁃	do_user_ana.sh

********************

module load singularity
/work/clas/clase1/tylern/clas6.img

the above commands can be added to .cshrc script so you don’t have to type them every time

the first step (if the files from your event generator are BOS files) is to run GSIM inside the docker container:

gsim_bat -ffread /path/to/gsiman.input -kine 1 -mcin <input bos file> -bosout

As written, this will produce a file labeled gsimout.A00 with a maximum file size of 2GB.
	⁃	If the file is larger than 2GB, then subsequent files will be named gsimout.A01, gsimout.A02, etc. 
	⁃	The gsiman.input file is an ffread card. 

After GSIM, the program GPP is used. GPP takes input bos files from GSIM as fileNameYouSpecify.evt. 

/bin/mv gsimout.A00 <fileNameYouSpecify.evt>

The script to run GPP is do_gpp.sh
	⁃	This script is essentially a wrapper that ensures GPP sees the correct g11 run index. 

./do_gpp.sh

Inside the wrapper, the main gpp command is:

gpp -P0x1f -o<output file> -R43582 -a1.0 -b1.0 -c1.0 -f1.0 -Y fileNameYouSpecify.evt

	⁃	P0x1f removes dead wires
	⁃	 43582 is the run number for the wire map, 
	⁃	coefficients a, b, c, and f, represent smearing parameters for DOCA regions 1-3 and time smearing, respectively.  The values of 1.0      correspond to minimal smearing. 
	⁃	The -Y flag drops DC hits according to the efficiency in the GPP map and the DC wire map in the database.

 USER_ANA is used to cook the MC data in the same way as real data. To run USER_ANA:

./do_user_ana.sh

like GPP, this script is essentially a wrapper that ensures user_ana sees the correct run index. **The input file for USER_ANA must be named clas.evt, unless you adjust this in the new_recsis.tcl file**. 

The main command inside do_user_ana.sh is: 

user_ana -t new_recsis.tcl 

	⁃	The new_recsis.tcl file specifies output banks (among many other things) and will produce an output bos file named clas.out with a maximum file size of 2 GB. 
  - If the file is larger, they will be subsequently labeled clas.out.A00, clas.out.A01, etc. 
  - An additional .hbook file, called ntuple.hbook, a log file, and anamonhist will be produced. 

If you would like to check the contents of any bos file, inside the docker container run

bosdump —help

and this will display options like only show a certain number of events, or events from a certain bank, etc.
